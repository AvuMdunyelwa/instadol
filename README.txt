A front-end K-pop website that showcases artists in a clean, user-friendly interface. The site displays a list of K-pop artists from a JSON data source, allows users to search and filter artists by name, and view individual artist detail pages by navigating through dynamic links.

Built with a strong focus on UX and design thinking, the project explores real-world front-end patterns such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, URL parameters, and responsive layout practices.
